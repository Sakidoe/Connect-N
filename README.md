# Connect-N
A program that takes in an number of columns, rows, and amount of connections to win. It then mimicks the real life 'Connect 4' game with different
parameters that the user has chosen, and when the user inputs a number between 1 - number of columns, it places an X, or O depending on turn.
The first person to have their pieces (either X or O) connect to the amount the user inputted in at the start wins.
